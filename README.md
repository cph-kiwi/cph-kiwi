### Hi there 👋, I'm Beth.

I am a Frontend developer currently building an AI-powered literature review tool at Silvi.ai. Originally from New Zealand, I hold two degrees from the University of Otago, where I studied Management, Psychology, and Philosophy. My journey into tech began in January 2020 when I decided to pursue a more fulfilling career path, teaching myself to code through freeCodeCamp and HackYourFuture. To my delight, I discovered software development to be deeply creative – a side of myself I'd never fully expressed before. My interdisciplinary background has proven surprisingly valuable, offering unique insights into user behavior and interface design, while my training in management and philosophy has shaped my approach to team leadership and logical problem-solving, helping me write cleaner, more thoughtful code.
