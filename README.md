### Hi there 👋, I'm Beth.

I am a software developer living in Copenhagen. I am enthusiastic and highly motivated, with experience in React. I am mostly self-taught, although I completed a bootcamp in June 2021. I am currently learning TypeScript and searching for a frontend developer role. [Check out my website and portfolio!](https://cph.kiwi/)
